        The trends across the months cannot be observed given the predictions is 2 months long.
        Nevertheless, the plot is informative enough. 
        The trend observed captures the low sales during Sundays (2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th August and 6th, 13th September.)
        From the train data, it is observed that most stores are closed on Sundays, hence the predicted sales for Sundays.
        The sales peak on Mondays then flatten during the remaining 5 days of the week.
